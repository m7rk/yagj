To make the drag and drop works, you need some step first:
-Create two empty objects, name them BlackShapes and NormalShapes.
-Drag into the scene the shape you want, put as a child of the BlackShapes object, then, on the Sprite Renderer, put the Color to black. 
	Then on Additional Settings, change the Sorting Layer to ShapeBlack.
-Drag into the scene the same object chosen before, but put it inside NormalShapes, change the Sorting Layer to Shape, then add a Box Collider 2D Component.
	At last add the Move System script, then on the Correct Form field, drop the corresponding black shape.
-Shapes must have they respectively tags to make the collisions work
